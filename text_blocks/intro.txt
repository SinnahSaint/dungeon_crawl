Welcome to Dungeon Crawl!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be kind to this poor dumb oldschool game. One or two words is all you need.
You will never need to type something like "Tickle the clown with a feather."
That would look more like "use feather" or "tickle clown".
----------------------------------------
You can move with N,S,E,W or use ? for help.
----------------------------------------

You've finally made it through the woods and to the hidden dungeon. 
Taking a deep breath, you step inside. . . . . .
