Welcome to Dungeon Crawl!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be kind to this poor dumb oldschool game. One or two words is all you need.
You will never need to type something like "Tickle the clown with a feather."
That would look more like "use feather" or "tickle clown".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you need to get out quickly there's a boss emergency function.
Just enter ! and the game will save your file with a default name,
as well as fill your screen with office-y text.
