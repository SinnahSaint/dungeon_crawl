Learn Ruby The Hard Way ex36 asked for a choose your own adventure style game using simple if/else statements and for loops....

That's boring so I'm making this instead.

I'm building a text based game like the classic Adventure game or the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books. 
I'm trying to write it simply for now but with an eye to multiple maps, encounter randomisation, and possible save games that can be reloaded.

I'm happy to say the basic 3x3 dungeon is up and running. More features and a bigger map will be added as I go, but the core game is there.

To play, just run the run.rb file.
