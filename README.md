# dungeon_crawl

I've built a text based game like the classic Adventure game or the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books. 
This is starting simply but with an eye to multiple maps, & encounter randomisation.

I'm happy to say the basic 3x3 dungeon with multiple maps is up and running. More features and a bigger maps might be added later, but the core game is there. You can even save and load games now.

To play, just run the run.rb file.
