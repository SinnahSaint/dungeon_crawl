Learn Ruby The Hard Way ex36 asked for a choose your own adventure style game using simple if/else statements and for loops....

That's boring so I'm making this instead.

I'm building a text based game like the classic Adventure game or the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books. 
I'm trying to write it simply for now but with an eye to multiple maps, encounter randomisation, and possible save games that can be reloaded.
